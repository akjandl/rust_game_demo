# Concept: top-down action adventure

An exploration of game design and Rust programming.

# Provisional plan

-   [ ] goal 1: user character in space, bounded movement
-   [ ] goal 2: interaction with non-playable game objects (e.g., shake a tree)
-   [ ] goal 3: interaction with NPC
-   [ ] goal 4: extend map beyond single screen, figure out how to nagivate
-   [ ] goal 5: basic sprites
-   [ ] goal 6: sound effects (music?)
-   [ ] goal 7: add combat system (attack training dummy, w/health, respawns on timer)
-   [ ] goal 8: add enemies
-   [ ] goal 9: add quest system
-   [ ] goal 10: add inventory/items
-   [ ] goal 11: add a store

# For each goal, prepare by:

-   Watching tutorials
-   Researching crates that could facilitate implementation
